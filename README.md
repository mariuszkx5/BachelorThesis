Abstract:
The purpose of this paper was to determine useful information about the
examined plant based on its digital images. This work consists of two main
issue. The first of these tasks is the estimation of the daily growth of the main
stem of the cucumber based on the digital processing of pictures of the tested
plant. The second goal is to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll in the
leaves of the plant by the example of the tomato using digital processing of
the leaf. The scope of work includes the developments of algorithms in order to
solve the problems. In addition to that, there are some theoretical foundations
required to implement the proposed algorithms mentionted earlier and a brief
overview of the existing solutions.
The study showed that the use of digital image processing to implement
the problems allowed for cheap and simple measuring, which under certain
conditions gives an acceptable result.

Keywords: digital image processing, chlorophyll content estimation, plant
